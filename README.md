# Project Overview
2-COM has a new client, Couch & Recline, that specializes in furniture sales. They have been in the furniture business for over 30 years. However, in the past 5 years, CEO Dustin Roiland has noticed a sharp decline in furniture sales. Couch & Recline's marketing research concluded that this is the result of their weak web presence. Dustin Roiland has asked 2-COM to design and develop a marketing site for current and future customers.

You are to develop a marketing site for Couch & Recline that lists various types of furniture, broken down by category. Feel free to use the internet for reference. If you don't get it done, it's ok!
