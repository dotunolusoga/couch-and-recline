# Project Overview
2-COM has a new client, Couch & Recline, that specializes in furniture sales. They have been in the furniture business for over 30 years. However, in the past 5 years, CEO Dustin Roiland has noticed a sharp decline in furniture sales. Couch & Recline's marketing research concluded that this is the result of their weak web presence.
