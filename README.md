# Interview Project

## Frontend Project
Here we’ll test your frontend abilities by having you develop a single page of a fictional marketing site.  The site will list various types of furniture, broken down by category.  Take an hour and code as much as you can on this design.  Feel free to use the internet for reference.  If you don’t get it done, it’s ok!

### Requirements
* Use MVC
* The view should consist of static markup – there is no database/backend
* Images files are located here:
  * Desktop\Assets\Images
* Web fonts are located here:
  * Desktop\Assets\Fonts
* Design/spec file is located here:
  * Desktop\Design

### Preferred
* Use SASS/LESS
* Don’t use any 3rd party jquery plugins
* Don’t use the default bootstrap on the new MVC project

## Backend Project
Here we’ll test your backend coding and SQL skills by extending the furniture site.  Create a database to house the products and product categories, as well as the newsletter signups.  Populate that database, and connect your view to it.  Good luck!

### Requirements
* Use MS SQL Server
* Store products, product category, and newsletter signups in the database

### Preferred
* Use Entity Framework
* Submit signup form without refreshing the page (AJAX)
* Send an email on signup form submission (smtp4dev is useful here)
